                <h3>I'm Yuri Castilho,</h3>
                <p>An 18-year-old FrontEnd developer who is always striving to improve himself.
                    I am currently in my last year of a technical course in Systems Development, where I learned design and programming langurages,
                    like javascript that I am using in this portfolio.
                    I have obtained several certificates and completed numerous projects during my two years as a programmer.
                    I am eager to continue pursuing this field that I enjoy so much.</p>
